  ## Goals

  For this project I started from scratch and used a weather API to build a weather dashboard.  This dashboard incorporates local storage so that previously searched cities an easily be viewed in future visits.

  ## Motivation

  A weather dashboard can be very helpful in monitoring current and future weather pattersn which in turn allows you to better plan your activities and wardrobe accordingly. It allows a user to see the current and five day forecast for temperature, wind speed and humitiy.  The current day forecast also includes and easy to read UV index indicator.

  ## Usage

  This weather dashboard can be used to get current and future forecast.  Third party APIs are essential tools in any developers belt, they allow users to make requests and gain access to data.  This endavor allowed me to become more familiar with using APIs in my projects. 

  ## Installation
  
  No installation needed, simply open in browser.  

  ## Test

  ## Problems

  Over the course of this project I learned a great deal about the functioning of APIs.  I'm now much better prepared to use them in my future projects.
